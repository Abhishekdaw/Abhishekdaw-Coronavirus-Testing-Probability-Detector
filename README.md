# Abhishekdaw-Coronavirus-Testing-Probability-Detector
Hi Guys!I have come up with a new solution for the Coronavirus Challenge by MHRD.Here is case:Lets take a case where there are 10,000 coronavirus suspects and we just have 5,000 testing kits available for that day.I have developed a logistic regression model where i have included features like Fever,runnynose,bodypain etc.This model will predict whether a person should be tested immediately for Covid-19 or not(If probability is >50%).The data that i have taken is random,there is no official source.
